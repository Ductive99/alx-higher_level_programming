# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Data structures are the building blocks of programming, and Lists and Tuples are two of Python's most essential data structures.

### Lists:

A list is like a collection, a shopping list in your favorite store for example. It allows you to store multiple items (elements) in one place.
The same is true for programming, defined using brackets '[]', lists are ordered collection of various data types.
- Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents (add, remove, modify items) after they are created.

### Tuples:

Tuples are also an ordered collection of various data types, unlike lists, tuples are immutable and are defined using '()' or comma seperated values.
They are usually used when you have a collection of items that should not change during the program's execution, like coordinates, configuration settings, or database record fields.
