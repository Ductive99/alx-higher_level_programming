# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

JavaScript, as a programming language, adheres to Object-Oriented principles, which means it revolves around the concept of objects and their interactions. Despite not being purely Object-Oriented like some other languages, JavaScript effectively integrates a plethora of Object-Oriented features and capabilities.

It's time to learn about:

- Objects  (store data and behavior)
- Scopes   (determine variable visibility and lifespan)
- Closures (retain access to variables from their lexical scope)
