JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. Whenever buttons are pressed or data is entered on forms, a response is initiated; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

### Resources

There are a lot of good resources to choose from, more than anybody could use them all. Spending time choosing the right resource instead of actually learning is a mistake all of us should avoid.

I am personally mainly using the mdn web docs:
