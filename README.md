# ALX - Higher-Level Programming

Welcome to the ALX Higher-Level Programming repository! A collection of projects (tasks) related to high-level programming languages.

## What's a high-level programming language

According to WIKIPEDIA, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.
