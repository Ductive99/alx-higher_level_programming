# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

As "beginner" developers testing seems like a useless and time-consuming that won't benefit us in any way.
We would be wrong. A simple addition function without testing would look something like this:
```
def add(a, b):
	return (a + b)
```
Testing teaches to better implement our function and programs in general, and to account for every case that might be.
